# My Awesome List

This is my own list of tools that I use on a regular basis. I cherry-picked those on different [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome) over the past years.
The goal is only to keep track of what I use and have all the links at one place.

For some entries, you'll se an  icon, that simply means that it is only available for either MacOS or iOS.
